    \begin{figure}

        \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{../src/mnist/regularized}
        \caption{Loss and accuracy for training and validation set as a function of the epoch, with regularization.}
    \end{figure}

Compared to the non-regularized approach, the validation set accuracy is closer to the training set accuracy.
In addition, the loss on the two daa sets is closer and the loss continues to decrease over a higher number of epochs.
This shows that regularization helps to generalize the model on unseen data and makes it more robust to overfitting.
