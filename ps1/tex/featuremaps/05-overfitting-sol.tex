        \caption{Overfitting example. Using a smaller amount of data points increases the tendency to overfitting.
        Since for any set of $\{(x_i,y_i)\mid x_i, y_i \in \mathbb{R}, i=1,\ldots k-1\}$ there is a polynomial $p_k$ of degree $k$ such that $p_k(x_i) = y_i$ $\forall i=1,\ldots, k-1$, 
        high-degree polynomials are very susceptible for overfitting, as they can match arbirtrary noisy data.}
