    \begin{figure}[h]
        \centering
        \includegraphics*[width=.7\linewidth]{../src/featuremaps/part_d.pdf}
        \caption{Polynomial fits with additional $\sin(x)$ feature. The lower degree fits fit the data better than the polynomial fits without the additional features.
        Again, overfitting can be observed for the fits with high values of $k$.}
